    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Version 40. Last modified 2016-05-12.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is the responsibility of each Client to read and understand this legal notice and the terms and conditions pursuant to which an acquisition of financial contracts via this site is governed.
    </p>
    <h2>A. Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
        The term "the Company" shall denote either Binary (IOM) Ltd., First Floor, Millennium House, Victoria Road, Douglas, IM2 4RW, Isle of Man, British Isles, licensed and regulated by (1) the Gambling Supervision Commission in the Isle of Man, British Isles, current online gambling licence issued on 31 August 2012, and for UK clients by (2) the UK Gambling Commission; Binary (Europe) Ltd., Mompalao Building, Suite 2, Tower Road, Msida MSD1825, Malta, licensed and regulated by (1) the Malta Gaming Authority in Malta for the Gaming products, licence no MGA/CL2/118/2000 dated 26th May 2010 and for UK clients by (2) the UK Gambling Commission; Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd Mompalao Building, Suite 2, Tower Road, Msida MSD1825, Malta, regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority for Investment products, holder of a Category 3 Investment Services licence no IS/ 70156; or Binary (CR) S.A., depending on the jurisdiction to which a Client's account has been attached in accordance with the account opening procedures of the website and as detailed in the About Us section of the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        These Terms and Conditions may be supplemented from time to time by Supplementary Terms and Conditions applicable to a particular Company or products.
    </p>
    <h2>B. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The financial trading services contained within this site are only suitable for Clients who are able to bear the loss of all the money they invest and who understand and have experience of the risks involved in the acquisition of financial contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
        International currency, stock index or commodity prices are highly volatile and very difficult to predict. Due to such volatility, plus the bias in the pricing system favouring the website (as described in more detail below), no financial contract purchased in our system (whether or not the payout exceeds the premium amount) can be considered a safe contract
    </p>
    <p>
        The maximum loss that may be incurred by any Client is the amount of money paid by oneself to the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to refuse and/or cancel services, charge deposit and/or withdrawal fees to anyone for any reasons including, but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul class='bullet'>
        <li>any instance where the Company believes that person's activities at this site may be illegal in that person's country or state;</li>
        <li>any instance where the Company may be approached or contacted by legal authorities or regulators from that person's country or state;</li>
        <li>any instance where the Company may suffer any pecuniary, fiscal or regulatory disadvantage by virtue of that person's activities at this site;</li>
        <li>any restriction to its Clients from purchasing any contracts during certain hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>C. Languages</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms and Conditions, for the convenience of our Clients are provided in several different languages; however, these translations do reflect the same principles. We attempt, as much as possible to provide a faithful translation in English of the prevailing language. In the event of any differences between the English version of the website and any other language, the English version shall prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may communicate with us through this website, by email or, exceptionally, by post. Details can be found in the Contact Us page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally we will communicate with you through this website or by email to the email address used when opening your account. We will communicate with you in English or, if you select another preferred language when opening your account, in that language.
    </p>
    <h2>D. Governing Laws and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
        Laws regarding financial contracts vary throughout the world, and it is the responsibility of persons accessing this site to ensure that they understand and fully comply with any laws or regulations relevant to themselves in their own country. This site does not constitute, and may not be used for the purposes of, an offer or solicitation to anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. Access to this site and the offering of financial contracts via this site in certain jurisdictions may be restricted and, accordingly, persons accessing this site are required to inform themselves about and to observe such restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The transactions performed on this site and the relationship between Clients and the Company are to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the country of incorporation of the Company (the "Jurisdiction"), which shall be either of the Isle of Man, Malta, or Costa Rica. You agree that the Jurisdiction's courts will have sole jurisdiction to settle any disputes that may arise in relation thereto. For such purposes, you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Jurisdiction in relation to any such dispute and you agree that any claim you might have against the Company shall only be brought before the courts of the Jurisdiction. For further information on complaints and disputes, kindly refer to the Company’s Complaints and Disputes section.
    </p>
    <h2>E. Contracts</h2>
    <p>
        The Company does not provide a market amongst or between Clients for investments, securities, derivatives or speculations. Each financial contract purchased by a Client via this site is an individual agreement between that Client and the Company and is not a security, nor is it transferable, negotiable or assignable to or with any third party.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acquisition of financial contracts through this site must be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions presented on the pages of this site. Acquisition of a financial contract is completed when the financial contract has been customised, the premium (or the payout, as the case may be) has been calculated and payment has been verified.
    </p>
    <h2>F. Client's Liability</h2>
    <p>
        Clients agree to be fully and personally liable for the due settlement of every transaction entered into under their account with the Company. This includes any transactions entered into by members of the Client's family or entourage who have gained access to the account. Clients are responsible for ensuring that they alone control access to the account, and that no minors are granted access to trading on the website. In any case, Clients remains fully liable for any and all positions traded on their account, and for any credit card transactions entered into the site for their account. Each Client also indemnifies the Company in respect to all costs and losses of any kind, whatsoever as may be incurred by the Company as a result, direct or indirect, of the Client's failure to perform or settle such a transaction. Online Gambling debts are enforceable in law in the Isle of Man.
    </p>
    <h2>G. Customer Funds</h2>
    <p>
        Money collected from Clients are not invested in any securities, futures, currencies, derivatives or other investments, on behalf of Clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are required by our licence to inform you about what happens to funds which we hold on account for you, and the extent to which funds are protected in the event of insolvency <a href='http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx' target='_blank'>http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The company holds customer funds in separate bank accounts to the operational accounts; and arrangements have been made to ensure assets in the customer accounts are distributed to customers in the event of insolvency. This meets the Gambling Commission’s requirements for the segregation of customer funds at the level: medium protection.
    </p>
    <p>
    The company has various deposit methods available, each with their own timing for deposits, some of which might not be available for withdrawals. Full details of deposits and withdrawals methods available including settlement times are available <a href='/binary-static/en/cashier/payment_methods.html' class='pjaxload'>here:</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your account should not be used as a banking facility and deposits should only be made with a view to using funds to place contracts. The Company is not a financial institution, Clients will not receive interest on deposits. Should you make repeated deposits and withdrawals without commensurate contracts being placed, we reserve the right to pass on to your accounts, without prior notice, any bank charges we have incurred before closing the account.
    </p>
    <h2>H. Fraud and Money Laundering</h2>

            </li>
            <li>
                The Company may, from time to time, at its sole discretion, or as required by regulations in place to conduct appropriate "Know Your Customer" procedures and require a Client to provide proof of identity (such as notarized copy of passport or other means of identity verification as the Company deems required under the circumstances) and may at its sole discretion suspend an account until satisfactory identification information, evidence of identity and address, source of funds and/or source of wealth have been provided. Know Your Customer documentation will be required when a Client deposits money in the account.

                You agree that we may use Personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.

    </p>
    <h2>I. Company's Right</h2>
    <p>
        The Company reserves the right to suspend the operation of this site or sections thereof:
        <ul class='bullet'>
            <li>
                When, as a result of political, economic, military or monetary events (including unusual market volatility or illiquidity) or any circumstances outside the control, responsibility and power of the Company, the continued operation of this site is not reasonably practicable without materially and adversely affecting and prejudicing the interests of Clients or the Company, or if, in the opinion of the Company, a price cannot be calculated for financial contracts.
            </li>
            <li>
                When there is a breakdown in the means of communication normally employed in determining the price or value of any of the financial contracts or where the price or value of any of the financial contracts cannot be promptly or accurately ascertained.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Company has and retains the right, to terminate any event or trade, including but not limited to the occurrence of any of the above events.

                In any event of an error in current prices, published odds or trading software.
            </li>
            <li>
                In all circumstances, the Company reserves the right to make changes to these Terms and Conditions.

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In such an event, the Company may at its sole discretion (with or without notice) close out Client's open financial contracts at prices it considers fair and reasonable at such a time and no claims may be entertained against the Company in connection thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further, the Company, under the above circumstances, or any other, reserves the right to adjust a client’s account should any trade result in a disruption, miscarry or aborted trade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the Company has and retains all rights to refuse or to close a Client’s account, the Company does warrant that all contractual obligations already made, shall be honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Company reserves the right to restrict client trading and/or cancel or reverse transactions in the case that any contracts are acquired or sold at prices that do not reflect fair market prices or that are acquired or sold at an abnormally low level of risk due to an undetected programming error, bug or glitch in our website software, market data feed or contract pricing latency, data feed error, stray quotes, incorrect pricing parameters, or manifest mis-calculation of prices or other manifest error. Clients have a duty to report to the Company any such problems, errors or suspected system inadequacies that they may experience and may not abuse of or arbitrage such system problems or errors for profit. The Company will endeavour to resolve any such difficulties in the shortest time possible. Persons with insider knowledge of any financial market or instrument are prohibited from trading at this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any information given on these pages and/or emails or newsletters sent by the company related thereto, is not intended as financial or investment advice and the Company will not accept any liability in this respect, nor will the Company accept any responsibility for the accuracy or comprehensiveness of the information provided on this site.
    <p>
    <p>
        The right is also reserved to amend or change the rules and scope of this service from time to time. Any change to the rules made whilst the site is in operation will not apply retrospectively and will only apply to acquisitions of financial contracts made after such change. It is the Company’s responsibility to notify Clients before any changes to its terms come into effect.
    </p>
    <h2>J. Dormant and Inactive Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        The company reserves the right to charge a dormant fee of up to USD/EUR/AUD/GBP25 every 6 months for every Client account that has had no transaction recorded for over 12 months.

Clients need to contact our helpdesk to recover funds from inactive, closed, blocked or excluded accounts.
    </p>
    <h2>K. Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The Company will not be liable in any way to any persons in the event of force majeure, or for the act of any Government or legal authority or for the failure of or damage or destruction to, its computer systems, data or records or any part thereof, or for delays, losses, errors or omissions resulting from the failure or mismanagement of any telecommunications or computer equipment or software.

    <h2>
        Trading Rules
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Company may impose certain rules and restrictions in relation to the placing of market orders on this website. Such rules may change from time to time, according to market conditions and other factors. The following indicative rules are currently in place:
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>
                Contracts will not usually be offered at odds under 0.05-to-1 (i.e. payouts of under USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 1.05 for each USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 1 staked).
            </li>
            <li>
                Contracts are not usually offered in the last hour of trade of any given market (for foreign exchange markets, the restriction may be extended up to 3 hours).
            </li>
            <li>
                Contracts will not usually be offered when the underlying market is at its intraday high or intraday low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contracts will not usually be offered during the first 10 minutes of market trade.
            </li>
            <li>
                During fast markets (i.e. periods of very fast market movements), contracts may be offered at prices more unfavourable than those offered in usual market conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Certain limits are imposed as to the acceptable levels for barrier/strike prices of contracts. Typically, the barrier/strike may not be too close nor too far from the current underlying market level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contracts may not expire on a weekend; therefore the expiry date of a contract may be pushed back to the following Monday in the event of a contract expiry date falling on a Saturday or a Sunday.
            </li>
            <li>
                Market prices are updated at most once per second.  For any given second, the market price will be updated to the first tick, if any, received in that particular second on the company datafeed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The company does not guarantee the ability to sell a contract prior to its expiration time.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contract Payouts</h2>
    <p>
        Contract payouts shall be determined by the Company by reference to the daily high/low/close values reported on this website relevant to the underlying index(ices) of the contract(s) or from the interbank trading data received by the Company for forex quotes or commodities prices as displayed on the website, subject that the Company shall have the right to make corrections to such data in the event of mis-priced or typographically incorrect data. Clients should note that the different markets may close at different times during the day due to local trading hours and time zones.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of single stock and stock index prices, the final closing price as reported by the relevant official Exchange shall apply for all settlements (this final settlement price may, at times, be reported by the relevant Exchange 30-90 minutes after the official closing time of the market, and may differ from the latest tick price that occurred at the closing time).
    </p>
    <p>
        For forex quotes the closing times are defined by the Company as shown in the Market Opening Times section of the website. In the event of any dispute regarding market or settlement values, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding. Clients should note that certain markets (such as stocks and stock indices) are not open throughout the day and that trading may not be available when the markets are closed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The calculation of the price to be paid (or the payout to be received) for financial contracts on this site at the time the financial contract is purchased or sold will be based on the Company's best estimate of market price movements and the expected level of interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the financial contract, and is based on complex mathematics. The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where stock indices or commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.
    </p>
    <p>
        The charting data made available to Clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company's decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding. The Company allows the option to sell contracts before expiry time of some contracts but will not be obliged to do so and can suspend this option depending on the current market conditions. Contracts may be amended when the underlying asset value is adjusted by corporate actions during the contract period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should a disruption occur in the data feeds which cannot be readily rectified by the Company, the Company reserves the right to refund the contract purchase.
    </p>
    <h2>Trading Limits</h2>
    <p>
        The Company may impose volume trading limits on Client accounts in its sole discretion. Current trading volume limits upon account opening are USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 30,000/day maximum trading volume. The maximum account size (i.e. cash balance) is USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 300,000 and the maximum outstanding contract payout at a given time per account is USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 25,000. These limits are increased once a Client is fully authenticated; where the new maximum trading volume will be USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 500,000, having a maximum account size of USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 300,000 and a maximum outstanding contract payout at a given time per account of USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 500,000. If the account balance exceeds the maximum account size, then withdrawals must be made to bring the balance down to under this limit.

However, the Company shall not be liable to you in any way if the Company is unable to identify a client as originating from your referral. Only properly tagged clients can be assigned to you. It is your responsibility to ensure that all links are properly tagged.</li>
                <li>The Company shall be entitled to exercise any of its rights or fulfill any of its obligations hereunder (including, but not limited to, its payment obligations) through any member of the Binary group of companies.</li>
                <li>The Company reserves the right to void, delay, or withhold payment of commission fees to you in situations including a suspected breach of a law or a breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>The Company may change the commission structure at any time at its sole and absolute discretion. We will endeavour to ensure affiliates are notified when changes have been made to the commission structure.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Ownership
            <ol class="reset_ol">
                <li>Ownership and content of the Binary.com website remains our respective properties and shall not be deemed to have been transferred to you through any act or omission in respect of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>Ownership, content, and liability of the Affiliate's websites are the sole responsibility of the Affiliate. You will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of your website and for all materials that appear on your website. You will indemnify and hold us harmless from all claims, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation to, attorneys' fees) relating to the development, operation, maintenance, and contents of your website.</li>
                <li>When the Affiliate’s referred clients open an account with any member of the Binary group, we assume ownership of the database of names and contact information and any other data of the Affiliates’ referred clients.</li>
            </ol>

        <li>Spam - We do not condone Spam
            <ol class="reset_ol">
                <li>Any form of Spam will result in your account being placed under review and all funds due being withheld pending an investigation into your account. You need to be aware that Binary.com is liable to incur expenses in dealing with Spam generated mail and these same expenses will be deducted from your account. In this instance the amount determined will be fair and deemed final and acceptable based on good faith and such amount will be collectable by law and deemed to have been accepted by yourself as fair and reasonable and as agreed to by registration as an affiliate of Binary.com.</li>
                <li>Should these expenses not be covered by funds in your account we reserve the right to investigate other alternative means for obtaining payment, for example: should your account have generated purchasing accounts, we will hold payment of commission for these accounts until such a time as the account for damages has been cleared.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Payments
            <ol class="reset_ol">
                <li>The Company shall pay you the currently published percentage of net revenues (as detailed on the commission page of your affiliate account) received during the term of the Agreement. The affiliate commission payments due shall only be for bona fide client referrals and the Company reserves the right to disregard duplicate accounts or nominee accounts that the Company sees as non-bona fide clients, at its sole discretion.</li>
                <li>The Company shall provide you with statements accessible through an electronic system detailing the revenues generated by clients you have referred, if any, which have accrued to you over the course of the calendar month. Such statements shall be updated daily. At the end of a calendar month, the Company shall record your total share of Net Revenues, if any, during the previous calendar month. In the event that a revenue share in any calendar month is a negative amount, the Company shall be entitled but not obliged to carry forward and set off such negative amount against future revenue shares which would otherwise be payable to you. However, the Company shall also be entitled but not obliged to zerorise the negative balance that would otherwise be carried forward.</li>
                <li>Payment of commission earned for the previous calendar month will be made monthly, on or around the 15th day of each month, and may be credited to any payment method as agreed between the Company and the Affiliate.</li>
                <li>If an error is made in the calculation of your share of the revenue share, the Company reserves the right to correct such calculation at any time, and to reclaim from you any overpayment made by the Company to you (including, without limitation, by way of reducing future payments earned, revenue to cover any processed chargebacks) before you can start earning revenue again. In special cases, the Company reserves the right to exclude revenue sharing  on promotional funds deposited into the client's account by the Company.</li>
                <li>Should any client for whom you are receiving commissions process a chargeback, the Company reserves the right to deduct the commission portion of the chargeback from the total balance due to you for the current month. Should this deduction of the accumulated revenue exceed your current amount due, your balance will then revert to a negative balance, and you will have to earn revenue to cover the chargeback before you can start earning revenue again. The Company reserves the right, in special cases, to exclude revenue sharing  on promotional funds deposited into the client's account by the Company.</li>
                <li>Commissions will be earned throughout the life of the client, on all transactions the client undertakes at the merchant, for as long as you, the Affiliate, remain a member of this affiliate program. The company reserves the right to cancel the commissions that are not reclaimed after 2 years.</li>
                <li>You are not allowed to rebate any part commission payment onto your referrals and should the company realise you are engaged in such actions; your affiliate account shall be revoked immediately.</li>

    <h2>Conflicts Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We provide here a summary of the policy we maintain in order to manage conflicts of interest in respect of the duties we owe to our clients.
    </p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
        It is understood that Binary Group companies, as trading counterparty, have an interest, relationship or arrangement that is material in relation to any trade effected on behalf of you and it is agreed that any company so interested shall be entitled to retain any benefit or profit received and shall not be liable to account therefore to you by reason only of such conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to establish and maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps to prevent conflicts of interest from constituting or giving rise to a material risk of damage to the interests of our clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have in place adequate internal procedures to ensure that you are in all cases treated fairly and that the risk of damage to client interests will be mitigated.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to keep a record of the kinds of activity we carry on in which a material conflict could arise or has arisen. We also maintain procedures to manage actual or potential conflicts. This includes procedures to maintain appropriate independence between members of our staff who are involved in potentially conflicting activities, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities and maintenance of a policy of independence which requires our staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest; and, in some circumstances declining to act for a client or potential client.
    </p>
    <h2>Disclosure: general</h2>
    <p>
        Where our arrangements to manage conflicts are not or cannot be sufficient to be reasonably confident that risks of damage to a client’s interest will be prevented we aim to disclose the general nature or sources of conflicts. This is aimed at allowing the client the opportunity to consider whether to ask for more information by sending an email to compliance<b></b>@<i></i>binary.com, or to continue with the service; we do not aim to provide detailed, highly specific or comprehensive information.

    <h2>Supplementary Terms and Conditions for Financial Products offered by Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd.</h2>
    <p>
        These Supplementary Terms and Conditions (these "ST&Cs") apply solely to clients ("you") of Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd ("BIEL", "we" or "us") and will govern the relationship between you and us when trading Financial Products (as defined below) with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        These ST&Cs form part of and need to be read together with the General Terms and Conditions relating to the use of Binary.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should read these ST&Cs carefully as well as the Summary Order Execution Policy and Summary Conflicts Policy, the applicable Contract Details together with the Risk Disclosure Notice and any other documents that we have supplied or in the future do supply to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        These ST&Cs begin to apply on the date we open your account, and, for any new versions after that, on the date we notify you.
    </p>

    <h2>About Us and our Regulator</h2>
    <p>
        BIEL is a company established in Malta under registration number C70156 and having its registered office at Mompalao Building, Suite 2, Tower Road, Msida MSD1825, Malta.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are authorised and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority ("MFSA") under the Investment Services Act (Cap. 370, Laws of Malta) (the "Act") to carry on investment business.  We are exclusively authorised by the MFSA to deal on own account (i.e. offer and act as counterparty to trades) and this in relation to financial derivative products (primarily binary options) relating to foreign exchange, indices, stocks and other financial products or assets ("Financial Products"). We are not authorised to and do not offer or provide investment advice or any other investment services other than dealing on own account in Financial Products. Should you feel that you require investment advice or investment services other that those described above then you should contact an independent financial advisor or firm.
    </p>
    <p>
        In providing these services, we are bound by the Act, any applicable regulations, bye-laws, licence conditions, guidelines, exchange requirements and other provisions or market practices (the "Rules"). In the event of conflict between these ST&Cs and the Rules, the latter should prevail.
    </p>

    <h2>Client classification</h2>
    <p>
        Under the Rules, clients may be categorised into one of the following three categories:
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>
                Retail Clients
            </li>
            <li>
                Professional Clients
            </li>
            <li>
                Eligible Counterparty
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The level of protection offered and due to each client depends on the category to which each client is assigned. Retail Clients benefit from the highest degree of protection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unless otherwise advised, we shall treat you as a Retail Client. You may also request, in writing, us to change the category in which you have been classified and this may have an effect on the level of protection afforded to you. We reserve the right to accept or refuse any such request for change in classification.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are entitled under the Rules to rely upon information provided by you. You should ensure that you provide us with accurate and complete information and notify us in the event that any information supplied to us changes. You should note that if you provide us with inaccurate information, or if you fail to notify us of any changes to information previously supplied by you, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that we can provide.
    </p>

    <h2>Appropriateness Test</h2>
    <p>
        In the course of provision of services we shall, where applicable, conduct an appropriateness test in order to determine whether, in our view and on the basis of the information provided by you, you have the necessary knowledge and experience in the investment field to understand the risks involved in the specific type of product or service offered or demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where we consider, on the basis of the information provided by you that you do not possess the knowledge and experience to appreciate the risks associated with an investment in the proposed instrument, we will issue a warning to you.  Such a warning shall be displayed on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where we do not manage to obtain sufficient information to assess the appropriateness of the product or service for you, we will similarly inform you that we are not in a position to assess appropriateness.
    </p>
    <h2>Best Execution Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Subject to any specific instructions which may be provided by you, when executing client orders, we will take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible results for you. The best possible results will be determined in terms of total consideration, that is, the price of the instrument and the costs related to execution which shall include all expenses incurred by you that are directly related to the execution of the order.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other best execution factors such as speed of execution, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature or any other considerations relevant to the execution of a particular order may also be applied by us in order to obtain the best possible results for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we exclusively deal on own account in Financial Products this means that we act as the execution venue and accordingly all transactions entered into with us will be executed outside a regulated market (stock exchange) or multilateral trading facility.
    </p>
    <h2>Clients' Money</h2>
    <p>
        Monies deposited by you with us in advance of a trade or pending withdrawal is treated by us as clients' money. We hold such monies in pooled or omnibus clients' money bank accounts opened with banks or other institutions ("Institutions"), segregated from our own money. Such clients' money bank accounts may be opened with EEA Institutions or Institutions outside the EEA. Where clients money is held with non-EEA Institutions this means that such accounts will be subject to laws other than those of an EEA member state and your rights may differ accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Financial Products that we offer to deal in are contracts entered into between you and us. Under these contracts and subject to the specific terms of the relevant contract, in consideration for the premium or price that you pay us, we promise to pay you a certain amount if the reference assets or measurements perform in a particular manner. These contracts accordingly are not instruments that we hold on your behalf and neither benefit from clients' assets protection in the event of our insolvency. Similarly the premium or price that you pay to take out a trade is not held as clients’ money but as consideration for our undertaking to pay.
    </p>
    <h2>Investor Compensation Scheme</h2>
    <p>
        BIEL forms part of <a href="http://www.compensationschemes.org.mt" target="_blank">the Investor Compensation Scheme</a> (the "Scheme") which is a rescue fund for investors that are clients of failed investment firms licensed by the MFSA. The Scheme covers 90% of the Company's net liability to a client in respect of investments which qualify for compensation under the Investment Services Act subject to a maximum payment to any one person of €20,000. The Scheme is based on EC Directive 97/9.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cover is made available on the basis of the depositor rather than on the basis of the number of deposits, meaning that if an individual has multiple accounts he will only be covered as to €20,000 on the global amount. Any other amount exceeding such threshold is not protected and will thus have to be borne by the investor.
    </p>
    <h2>Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
        These ST&Cs are to be governed by and construed in accordance with Maltese law and the parties hereto agree to submit to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the Maltese courts.

        <div class="grd-grid-12">
    <h2>
        Data Feed
    </h2>
    <p>
        Information about the data feeds used by our company, and how the data is processed before being fed into the system.
    </p>
    <h2>Filtering Stray Ticks</h2>
        <p>
        Depending on the quality of the data feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might apply a tick filtering algorithm. The purpose of this filtering algorithm is to strip the feed of stray ticks. Stray ticks are ticks that manifestly fall outside of the current trading range of the market; such ticks are often due to communication delays with the exchanges or banks that provide quotes, human error, or database problems at any point between the originator of the quote and our servers.
        </p>
    <p>
        The filtering algorithm may for example be similar to the "Bollinger Bands" volatility system - i.e., short-term volatility bands are determined around the present market value, and ticks that are manifestly outside of such bands are removed.
    </p>
    <h2>Smoothing out random noise</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on the quality of the feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might also apply a very short-term smoothing algorithm to the data feed. This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the "random noise" surrounding the data feed, and ensures that clients who buy path-dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked-in or knocked-out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.
    </p>
    <h2>Differences with other data feeds</h2>
    <p>
        Our data feed may at times differ slightly from other data feeds found on the internet (who may themselves differ between each other). Reasons for differences in feed providers include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no 'official' price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly prices may differ between providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.
        </li>
        <li>The smoothing and filtering algorithms described above.</li>
        <li>
        Market-closing times: Please refer to <a href="/binary-static/en/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading Times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example some websites choose 4 o'clock NY time, or 5 o'clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low and closing prices displayed on our website may differ to those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of bid/ask prices: when the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. Our system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, our website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.
        </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p>
  <h2>Weekend quotes</h2>
  <p>Please note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices, however these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push up or down prices). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Binary.com's policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for the volatility indices, which are open during weekends).</p>

    <h2>Contract Risks</h2>
    <p>
        You should not trade or invest in Binary Options unless you know and understand the features risks involved and you may lose all the money invested.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Binary" or "digital" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple "Yes or No" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions. You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is your responsibility, taking into account your personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com, as well as prior to making any individual order. Where you do not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, you should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If you continue to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, you should not trade at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than investments which are so traded.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are warned of the following additional risks:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument which a Binary Options refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by you or Binary.com.
            </li>
            <li>
                Binary.com makes efforts that the quoted prices of each underlying asset that a Binary Option refers to will be reasonably related to the actual prices of such asset available in the market. Binary.com makes no warranty, expressed or implied, that the quoted prices represent prevailing market prices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Binary.com may have access to information that is not available to you, may have acquired trading positions at prices that are not available to you, and may have interests different from your interests. Binary.com does not undertake any obligation to provide you with market or other information we possess, nor to alter or refrain from our own trading.
            </li>
            <li>
                Information of the previous performance of any underlying instrument or asset does not guarantee its current and/or future performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Risks of Investment Products</h2>
    <p>
        Investing or trading in Contracts exposes you to the performance of the underlying or reference instrument or asset to which the Binary Contract refers including foreign exchange, indices, stocks and commodities each of which have their own features and risks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Exchange Rate Risk</strong>: Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political and other conditions, exposing you to risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying investment product. If you deposit funds in a currency to trade Contracts denominated in a different currency, your gains or losses on the underlying investment therefore may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Other Risks</strong>: There are other risks that relate to trading investment products and trading foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if economic or political or other unforeseen events locally or overseas affect the market. In addition to these types of risk there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that you should consider.

    <h2>Summary Order Execution Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We have a general duty to conduct our business with you honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in your best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        More specifically, when we enter into a Binary Option trade with you (each, a "Contract"), we have a duty to provide you with ‘best execution’. Best execution means that we must take reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for you when executing an order with you. This document provides a summary of our best execution policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should note that our duty to provide you with best execution does not apply to any gambling products that you place with us, where there is no underlying financial market.
    </p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
        When we enter into Contracts with you, we will take all reasonable steps to achieve the best possible result for you by executing those Contracts according to our order execution policy and subject to any specific instructions received from you. Our order execution policy comprises a set of procedures that are designed to obtain the best possible execution result for you subject to and taking into account: (a) the nature of your Contracts, (b) the priorities you have identified to us in relation to entering into those Contracts, and (c) the practices relating to the market in question, with the aim of producing a result which provides, in our view, the best balance across a range of sometimes conflicting factors. Our policy cannot provide a guarantee, however, that when entering into Contracts with you, the price will always be better than one which is or might have been available elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h2>Best Execution Factors</h2>
    <p>
        In relation to Contracts that you enter into with us, we act as principal and not as agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the sole execution venue for the execution of your Contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are required to take a number of factors into account when considering how to give you best execution. We have rated price as the most important followed by: (a) costs; (b) size, (c) liquidity of the underlying market, (d) speed and (e) likelihood of execution and settlement. The main way in which we will ensure that you obtain best execution is by ensuring that in our calculation of our bid/offer prices, we pay due consideration to the market price for the underlying reference product to which your Contract relates. We have access to a number of different data sources in order to ascertain the market price, which is our objective view of the bids and offers available to arms' length traders.
    </p>
    <p>
        In relation to some Contracts, at the time at which you give us an order there may be no functioning or open market or exchange on which the reference product is traded. In such cases, we set out to determine a fair underlying price based on a number of factors such as price movements on associated markets and other market influences and information about our clients' own orders.
    </p>
    <h2>Specific Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Where you give us specific instructions, including for example (a) specifying the price of a Contract with us or (b) specifying the price at which a Contract is to be closed, then those instructions take precedence over other aspects of our policy.
    </p>
    <h2>No fiduciary duty</h2>
    <p>
        Our commitment to provide you with 'best execution' does not mean that we owe you any fiduciary responsibilities over and above the specific regulatory obligations placed upon us or as may be otherwise contracted between us.
    </p>
    <h2>Monitoring and review of this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.
